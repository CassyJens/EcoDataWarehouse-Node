Alone time means different things to different people. For Connor, it's an exploration on the bluff, a chance to marvel at nature without contemplation or interruption from others. For my mom, it's being trapped inside a shaded house, phone off, and without complex thoughts or regrets. For me, alone time is a chance to reflect. Alone time is time without judgement, when you can just be yourself, and not feel that you owe anything to anyone.

I'm 28 years old, but I feel that I have the life-skills of a 20 year old and the wear and tear of a 30 year old. I don't have any goals other than graduating from college, making my relationship work, and not loosing my job. I'm really sounding pathetic, but honest at least.

I live in La Crosse WI because this is where I ended up.
I live in La Crosse WI because I've found an abundance of positivity, natural resources for recreation, and friends. 
I live in La Crosse WI because I am finishing up my undergraduate here, which is only weeks away from completion.
I live in La Crosse because I have family in the midwest.
I live in La Crosse because I don't know where I'd rather be, and how I would get there.
I live in La Crosse because I like Ultimate Frisbee in the summer and the Madison Farmer's Market.

I've arrived at my career.

I will be finishing up this journal entry in order to work on my math homework. I'm getting a solid D in the class, and it's more than half way over time-wise. I hope to finish with at least a C, meaning I must improve on my test scores, drastically. I have around 40 more points I can loose to still pass the class.

Later, I need to do my taxes as they're due in 8 days.
