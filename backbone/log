things learned while working with dynamic sql
1. Any variables added to a dynamic string must be nvarchar(max) or of a specific length
2. Any variables "" must be at least nvarchar
3. Any variables "" may not be anything other than nvarchar
4. nvarchar(size) is very important in how dynamic sql works
5. Print out the dynamic sql to make sure it's something (if you don't concat variables using nvarchar, it will be nothing)
